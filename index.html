      I am a student at the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp.  My technical background is primarily based in semiconductors.  I hope to use my semiconductor backgound along with the knowledge I hope to gain from UCD Bootcamp to launch myself into a successful high tech career.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of my studies, I am a volunteer with the American Cancer Society, an avid cyclist, both on the road and up the mountain and enjoy life with my family and friends! </p>
